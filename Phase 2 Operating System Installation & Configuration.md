Phase 2: Operating System Installation & Configuration

Goal: To successfully install and configure a dedicated operating system on two of my repaired laptops, setting them up for their specific roles in the home lab.

Key Tasks: Created bootable USB drives for Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server. Installed Kali Linux on the HP Pavilion for cybersecurity projects. Installed Ubuntu Server on the Toshiba Satellite to function as a server. Troubleshot and resolved common installation errors.

Outcome: Successfully installed and configured both operating systems. The HP Pavilion is now running Kali Linux, and the Toshiba Satellite is running Ubuntu Server.
