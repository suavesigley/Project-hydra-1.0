Key Tasks: Used a SystemRescue USB to boot each machine, run hardware diagnostic tests on the CPU and hard drives, and visually inspect components like RAM and hard drive connectors.

Outcome: Identified the desktop needed an SSD and DDR3/DDR3L RAM and that the laptops had issues ranging from failed hard drives to a failed CPU. Repaired the desktop by installing a 1TB SSD and two new RAM sticks.
