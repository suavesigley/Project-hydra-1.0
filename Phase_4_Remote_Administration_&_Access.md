Phase 4: Remote Administration & Access
Goal: To demonstrate the ability to manage a server remotely from a client machine.

Key Tasks: Used SSH from the Kali Linux laptop to securely connect to and administer the Ubuntu server from a distance. Practised executing commands and managing files without a physical keyboard or monitor on the server itself.
