# Project hydra 1.0
IT Home Lab & Portfolio ðŸ’»
Hello! I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional building my skills through hands-on projects. This portfolio documents my journey from a collection of broken computers to a fully functional home lab, demonstrating my ability to diagnose, repair, and deploy IT solutions.

Project Overview
This project began with a challenge: to take five non-functional computersâ€”one desktop and four laptopsâ€”and bring them back to life. Through a systematic approach, Iâ€™ve successfully diagnosed hardware failures, installed new components, and configured different operating systems to serve specific purposes for a help desk and cybersecurity environment.

My Home Lab Specs
Desktop: Diagnosed with a need for a new SSD and DDR3/DDR3L RAM.
HP Pavilion Laptop: Upgraded with a new SSD and RAM to become a dedicated ethical hacking machine.
Toshiba Satellite Laptop: Upgraded with a new SSD and configured as an Ubuntu file server.
Other Laptops: Two additional laptops, one diagnosed with a hard drive replacement and one with a CPU failure.
Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+: A mobile device being used for a hardware repair project (screen replacement).

Skills Demonstrated
Hardware Troubleshooting & Diagnostics: Used tools like SystemRescue to identify and confirm hardware failures.
Operating System Installation: Experience with installing and configuring various operating systems, including Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server.
Linux Administration: Proficient in using the command line to manage a Linux server, including package installation (apt), file sharing (Samba), and remote management (SSH).
Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Hands-on experience with ethical hacking principles, network scanning (Nmap), and secure configurations.
IT Operations: Practiced with ticketing and asset management concepts using a self-hosted platform.
