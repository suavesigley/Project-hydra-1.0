The IT Home Lab & Portfolio

Hello! As an aspiring cybersecurity professional building my skills through hands on projects. This portfolio documents my journey from a collection of broken computers to a fully functional home lab. demonstraing my ability to diagnose, repair and deploy IT solutions.

Project Overview
This project began with a challenge: attaining 5 non functional computers, 1 desktop and 4 laptops, and bringing them back to life. through a systematic approauch, ive succesfully diagnosed harderware failures, installed new components and configured different operating systems to serve specific purposes for help desk and cybersecurity environment.

My Home Lab Specs
Desktop; diagnosed with a need for a new SSD and DDR3 RAM
hp pavillion laptop; diagnosed with a need for a new SSD
toshiba satellite c50D-A laptop; diagnosed with a need for a new SSD and configures as an ubuntu file server
toshiba satellite U400 laptop;  diagnosed with a need for a more ram
alienware laptop; diagnosed with CPU failure
samsung galaxy tab A9+; 80% screen smashed

Skills Demonstrated
Hardware Troubleshooting & diagnostics; used tools SystemRescue to identify and confirm hardware failures
Operating Systeam Installation; experience with installing and configuring various operating systems including Kali linux, windows and ubuntu
Linux Administration; Proficient in using the command line to manage linux server including package installation(apt), filesharing (samba) and remote management (SSH)
Cybersecurity Fundamentals; hands on experience with ethical hacking priniciples, netwrk scanninf (nmap) and secure configurations
IT Operations; Practiced with ticketing and assest maagement concepts using a self hosted platform

Project Walkthroughs
That's a fantastic idea. Your README.md will be the front door to your portfolio, giving anyone who visits a quick overview of who you are and what you've accomplished.

Here is a template you can use for your GitHub Pages README.md, filled in with the details of your home lab and projects. Just copy and paste this into your README.md file and you'll be set.

IT Home Lab & Portfolio
Hello! I'm an aspiring help desk and cybersecurity professional building my skills through hands-on projects. This portfolio documents my journey from a collection of broken computers to a fully functional home lab, demonstrating my ability to diagnose, repair, and deploy IT solutions.

Project Overview
This project began with a challenge: to take five non-functional computers—four laptops and one desktop—and bring them back to life. Through a systematic approach, I've successfully diagnosed hardware failures, installed new components, and configured different operating systems to serve specific purposes for a help desk and cybersecurity environment.

My Home Lab Specs
Desktop: Diagnosed with a need for a new SSD and DDR3/DDR3L RAM.

HP Pavilion Laptop: Upgraded with a new SSD and RAM to become a dedicated ethical hacking machine.

Toshiba Satellite Laptop: Upgraded with a new SSD and configured as an Ubuntu file server.

Other Laptops: Two additional laptops, one diagnosed with a hard drive replacement and one with a CPU failure.

Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+: A mobile device being used for a hardware repair project (screen replacement).

Skills Demonstrated
Hardware Troubleshooting & Diagnostics: Used tools like SystemRescue to identify and confirm hardware failures (e.g., failed hard drives, incompatible RAM).

Operating System Installation: Experience with installing and configuring various operating systems, including Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server.

Linux Administration: Proficient in using the command line to manage a Linux server, including package installation (apt), file sharing (Samba), and remote management (SSH).

Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Hands-on experience with ethical hacking principles, network scanning (Nmap), and secure configurations.

IT Operations: Practiced with ticketing and asset management concepts using a self-hosted platform.

Project Walkthroughs
Of course. Breaking your project into phases is a great way to showcase your progression and the variety of skills you've developed. This structure will make your portfolio easy to follow for recruiters and hiring managers.

Here are seven distinct phases you can use for your portfolio walkthroughs, filled in with your project details.

Project Walkthroughs
Phase 1: Hardware Diagnosis & Troubleshooting

Goal: To diagnose and identify the hardware issues with all five non-working computers.

Key Tasks: Used a SystemRescue USB to boot each machine, run hardware diagnostic tests on the CPU and hard drives, and visually inspect components like RAM and hard drive connectors.

Outcome: Successfully identified that the desktop needed an SSD and DDR3/DDR3L RAM, and that the laptops had issues ranging from failed hard drives to a failed CPU.

Phase 2: Operating System Installation & Configuration

Goal: To install specific operating systems to serve different functions in the home lab.

Key Tasks: Installed Kali Linux on the HP laptop for ethical hacking. Installed Ubuntu Server on the Toshiba laptop to set it up as a file server. Overcame boot errors by troubleshooting and disabling Secure Boot in the BIOS.

Phase 3: File Server & Help Desk Implementation

Goal: To configure one of the laptops as a functional file server and help desk hub.

Key Tasks: Installed and configured Samba on the Ubuntu laptop to enable network file sharing. Set up a shared folder that is accessible to other devices on the network.

Phase 4: Remote Administration & Access

Goal: To demonstrate the ability to manage a server remotely from a client machine.

Key Tasks: Used SSH from the Kali Linux laptop to securely connect to and administer the Ubuntu server from a distance. Practiced executing commands and managing files without a physical keyboard or monitor on the server itself.

Phase 5: Virtualisation

Goal: To set up a virtualisation platform to run multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware.

Key Tasks: Installed the KVM hypervisor and its management tools on the Ubuntu server. Learned to create and manage virtual machines from the command line, which is a key skill for a professional IT environment.

Phase 6: Cybersecurity Projects & Testing

Goal: To use the home lab to perform ethical hacking and security testing projects.

Key Tasks: (Future Project) Will install a vulnerable operating system like Metasploitable in a KVM virtual machine. Will use the Kali Linux machine to run network scans with Nmap and identify vulnerabilities.

Phase 7: Advanced Projects & Documentation

Goal: To take on more advanced tasks and build a complete portfolio with thorough documentation.

Key Tasks: (Future Project) This is where you would build a "honeypot" to detect and log malicious activity. You would also document the entire journey, including your hardware repair project for the tablet, to create a comprehensive portfolio website on GitHub.
