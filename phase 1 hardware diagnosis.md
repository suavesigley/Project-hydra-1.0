Phase 1: Hardware Diagnosis & Troubleshooting

Goal: To diagnose and identify the hardware issues with all five non-working computers.

Key Tasks: Used a SystemRescue USB to boot each machine, run hardware diagnostic tests on the CPU and hard drives, and visually inspect components like RAM and hard drive connectors.

Outcome: Successfully identified that the desktop needed an SSD and DDR3/DDR3L RAM, and that the laptops had issues ranging from failed hard drives to a failed CPU.
